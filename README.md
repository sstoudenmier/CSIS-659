CSIS 659 - Service Oriented Computing
---
Final project from CSIS 659 course. Included are three files:
* FetchData.py
* RiotAPI.py
* FinalPaper.doc

The goal of the project was to show how REST requests are sometimes hierarchical in nature. When this occurs you can parse through them through the use of muliple API keys, or whatever authentication method is used, to dramatically increase the efficiency. The API for Riot Games' "League of Legends" was used to demonstrate capabilities. 

This project was an extended abstract and therefore the first iteration.
